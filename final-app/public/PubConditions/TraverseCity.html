        TRAIL UPDATE!! I just rode a loop of our trail system. The 5-8 inches of snow we received really helped. Keep in mind that the base consists of hard pack and ice so there are some icy corners but overall 
        the trail were in pretty decent shape considering. The North trail was decent and the trail from the Kalkaska warming hut South toward Fife Lake was really nice with lots of fresh snow. The Jack Pine Rd trail
         was also in nice shape. The best news of all is a just received a text from our groomer coordinator that ALL of our trail system will be completed groomed tonight. This could be the last couple of days to go riding 
         before a warm front hits Sunday. Get out with the family or friends this weekend! Stop by Ranch Rudolph and sit by their killer fire place and have a hot chocolate or lunch. They are a huge supporter of our club and 
         trail system so please help support them! HAVE A GREAT WEEKEND EVERYONE!
