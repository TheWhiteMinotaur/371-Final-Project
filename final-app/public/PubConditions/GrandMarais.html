    Hello Sledheads, what better way to spend the day maintaining a social distance,putting on a helmet and riding this beautiful area. 
    The trails are in beautiful shape. Getting around town is lousy. It’s best to trailer to the Trail head’s. You can make it into town to the gas station. 
    Of course we only have takeout food options. We are forecasted to get some fresh snow Thursday night into Friday. I’ll update the conditions the next 
    time we have a noticeable change. Remember Ride Right and be safe! Looking for a sled to rent or a beautiful home to stay in downtown give us a call 906-774-4700 
    or book online www.gmpowersports.com We will be renting through this weekend.
