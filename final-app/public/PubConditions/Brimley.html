        Pickles trail Report for 3/9/20 –--TRAILS are still in good shape.. All those that came up this past weekend were not disappointed... 
        There is going to be a few days of warm weather this week so some of the snow will melt and the roads will be clear, but there is still a thick base 
        on the trails and they will be good to ride probably through the next two weeks. We have a few days of snow in the forecast this week and next week to help even 
        more. .. ----------------------------- --------------------------------------------------- ----------I figure we have a few weekends left of good sledding weather and trails so get it in while you can..
