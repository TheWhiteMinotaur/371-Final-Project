    <P>
        Thank you to the snowmobilers who stayed with us this past season and thanks to those who called to check on conditions! Even though we had a short season here on the west side of the state, we were able to get some good riding in here and there. Since it's "warming" up, think fishing! We are located close to prime fishing rivers and lakes. The Big Sauble is 1.5 miles south. The Little Manistee, Pine, Pere Marquette, Manistee are all within a short drive. We have 6 small cabins that will sleep up to 4 people and a large fully furnished cabin that will sleep up to 7. Contact us and we'll set you up, or take a look at our website for pictures and information if you would like to explore trails in our area.
