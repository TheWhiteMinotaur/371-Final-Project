 An update just to stay in touch with all you sledheads out there...Yesterday's weather felt like spring, thanks to temps in the upper 50's and some light rain. Sunday was also in 
 the 50's but no rain. The last 2-3 days have melted off a lot of snow and ice. No one is out riding, for obvious reasons. Last night the mercury dropped and this morning we've got 
 clouds and upper 20's. We've also seen some light snow. The view outside is a mixture of old snowbanks, icy areas, wet areas, and muddy areas. I don't want to declare the "overweight" 
 lady is singing, but she's definitely warming up. Of course we'll expect to see at least one more snow storm before it's all over. Whether it's enough to allow any more riding remains to be seen. 
 This season has been the worst ever when it comes to riding conditions. We just haven't seen the snow areas just to our south did. Not much we can do but our volunteers worked magic with what we 
 did get. So a big thanks to all those who volunteer as drivers, those who stop while riding and pick up branches and debris on the trail, those who checked in and reported conditions from the trail, 
 and those who supported our grooming club with a membership donation or hat/tee purchase. You all are the best! If we get a last hurrah I will post again. Until then... If you're over winter we 
 invite you to our annual IN-HOUSE BOAT SHOW, MARCH 20-28 at Burt Lake Marina! Our showroom will be full of 2021 watercraft! See what's new from Sea-Doo PWC, Bennington pontoons, Four Winns runabouts, 
 Floe & Shore Station dock & hoist, and more. We'll be offering special pricing on the new 2020 boats only available during the show, as well as blowout pricing on any remaining 2019 inventory! Visit
  our website for more information: burtlakemarina.com. And if you're still in the market for a new Ski-Doo snowmobile, now is definitely the time. All remaining Ski-Doo sleds are priced to go. 
  Spring Fever is also on for the 2021 line up. You can check out the 2021 Ski-Doo line up this Sunday at Soaring Eagle resort in Mt. Pleasant-we'll be there! Need parts and summarization service 
  or accessories for your sled? Our service and parts department is second to none. Call or email for your appointment now: 231-238-8265 or service@burtlakemarina.com. Open Monday-Friday, 8:30 -
