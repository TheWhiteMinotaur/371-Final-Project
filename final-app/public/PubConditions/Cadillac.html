        Hello- Just wanted to again say Thank You to all you sledders who supported Coyote this past snowmobile season. 
        Although this was a very trying season for snow, we did survive and now we have the Covid-19 crisis to deal with. 
        We are currently closed, other than 1 day/week grocery pick-ups. One thing we are offering and wanted to share with you all, 
        is that we are selling gift certificates at a 10% discount, for limited time. If interested, please call with credit card and we can send 
        these out to you. Also, we are planning a outdoor Summer Concert Series on our new stage....Hopefully starting in June?? Stay safe and hope 
        to see you all next season, or hopefully sooner. Regards, Pete 231-862-3212
        <P>
