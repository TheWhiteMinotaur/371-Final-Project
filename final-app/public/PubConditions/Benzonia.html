        Hi all! Well it WAS starting to look good out there but now for several days we have had temps around 40 and
        sunshine.
        Trails have some snow but it's an icy dirt base under it. Groomers won't be out again till we get snow. So, I am
        sorry, but it's not good news again.
        All we can do is hold out hope for March? Who knows! March has proven to be a snow month in the past sometimes
        so let's hope? Thanks for the email Rick!
        Let's hope I can say "See ya on the trails" soon! Carol :-)
        <P>
