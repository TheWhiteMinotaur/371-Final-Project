    <P>
        Well here we are, the last weekend for us here at the Magnuson Grand and The Inn in beautiful downtown Paradise! We will be closing for the season on Sunday :(
            But we still have the weekend! Trails are groomed and in pretty good shape considering the way this weather has been this past week. We have some icy conditions but still plenty of snow in the woods. 
            I have had a couple different groups here this whole week and they have been having a great time. These guys will ride 200+ miles a day. They went in every direction you can go from Paradise and all trips were great. 
            There is some areas that you have to deal with during late season riding, parking lots and dirt roads that are a portion of the trail but non of them are very long and you will have no problem passing them.
            
            We are experiencing significant winds right now, sustained 20-25mph with gusts up to 45. The Mackinaw bridge has been escorting trucks and trailers all day so be prepared to stop if you're coming U.P. tonight.
            
            Like I said this is our last weekend and we would like to thank you all that stuck with us, stuck with your planned trip and came U.P. anyway to ride our trails. It was a very stressful winter for us regarding the weather, 
            and the fluctuating temperatures just put a damper on things. It started in November when we had 56 inches of snow fall and one of the coldest Novembers I can remember. We were all super excited for the season to start, 
            until it all melted just before Christmas. Then the epic ice storm New Years Eve that made National news! We survived! We had good snow fall just before MLK weekend that helped us out there and then winter hit us finally, 
            in February. Even though we continued to get snow every 4- 5 days, we still had above normal temperatures that did help keep the trail base packed but also was no help to the grooming and keeping your sleds cooled. It has 
            been one of the strangest winters I have ever been through in 41 years U.P. here. But we made it through another one and it is because of our loyal guests that continue to come no matter what and make the best of it!
            
            If any of you sled riders are into the side x sides or quads it is great riding up here Spring, Summer and especially Fall! We will be open again the first part of May if you are interested. You can ride to the trails right 
            from our parking lot and go pretty much every where you go on your sled, except the state park property. Give us a call and we will give you all the information you need for that.
            
            Thank you again and maybe we will see you this summer and if not, we will see you all next winter!
        <P>
