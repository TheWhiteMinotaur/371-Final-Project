    Snow expected for the weekend. Spring riding time. While you are free to ride in the fresh air and sunshine, we are
    not able to serve you at this time. Rats!
    Looks like we will have to miss our March people. Maybe time left to serve the April Fools. Either way, enjoy your
    St. Patrick's Day safely. Thanks for a great winter!
